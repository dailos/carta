You only need docker to be installed in your system
Copy .env.example to .env

NOTE: if php is not present you can still install Sail with:

docker run --rm \
    -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
    -v $(pwd):/opt \
    -w /opt \
    laravelsail/php80-composer:latest \
    composer install --ignore-platform-reqs

run docker-compose up -d to start developing
docker-compose down to stop developing
docker-compose exec app bash to access to shell (for example, to run composer install)
